# FlashcardDecks
My Flashcard decks for the second semester
I use the repo [Ankdown](https://github.com/benwr/ankdown) to convert my markdown files to anki cards.
If you want to use the cards as well, just follow the instructions on how to install ankdown and you can convert them into anki cards aswell.
